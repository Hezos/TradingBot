Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income expands equity exploration by including items not typically seen on a traditional income statement. It accounts for adjustments in securities held for sale by the firm, unrealized gains or losses on investments, hedging activities, foreign currency exchange rate changes, and adjustments to future pensions.

Some companies produce a separate statement for comprehensive income, while others include it as a footnote on the income statement. While it is easy to overlook, comprehensive income gives a much fuller picture of the company's financial position.
